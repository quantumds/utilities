# CLONE A REPOSITORY:
git clone route_of_git_with_the_repo

# COMMIT CHANGES:
git commit -am “comment_that_explains_this_commit”
git push origin name_of_branch_where_you_are_doing_your_changes

# WATCH HOW MANY BRANCHES ARE IN THE REPO:
git branch –r

# CREATE A NEW BRANCH:
git checkout -b name_of_the_new_branch
git push origin name_of_the_new_branch

# CREATE AN EMPTY FILE:
touch name_of_the_file.txt

# CREATE AN EMPTY FOLDER:
mkdir name_of_the_new_folder

# MOVE FILE FROM PLACE TO DIRECTORY:
mv file.txt doc

# BEFORE DOING A COMMIT WITH SUBFOLDERS
git add name_of_folder_/name_of_folder/name_of_file.termination

# OTHER TIPS FOR COMMITING ADDING FOLDERS AND FILES:
git add . # (This will add all files of the current directory to track (including untracked).
git add -A # One liner that does the same thing is:

# KNOW IN WHICH BRANCH YOU ARE:
git status
